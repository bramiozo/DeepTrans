# DeepTrans
Simple library to facilitate translation with API and models.

# Why 
In working with medical NLP in non-english languages we often encounter a lack of source material;
raning from un-labeled raw text, to labeled corpora


# What

Applications in mind are:
* translation of text-elements of XML/JSON objects
* translation of list of pairs/triplets/...
* inclusion of glossary, e.g. UMLS-translations
* translation of Panda dataframes
